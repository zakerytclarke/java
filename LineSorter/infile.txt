This is a test.
Only a test.
A test of your code.
  Some lines have white space
some are lowercase
1234 some have numbers

some even were blank

some lines are the same length A
some lines are the same length C
some lines are the same length B

It doesn't matter what characters are on the line or how long it is.
I'm sure your code can sort them all.
!@#$%^&* (even if there are special characters)
really, don't go overthinking this one.
